<h1>Special Events Policies</h1>
 
<p>
	Events such as weddings, graduations, bar mitzvahs, dances, concerts, quincineras, proms, fundraisers, etc. are classified as &ldquo;special events.&rdquo; 
	These types of events are more detailed and consequently require more labor and resources to plan.  Because these events are more complicated, they are priced 
	differently than a standard banquet event. In planning these events, it is necessary for the Event planning staff to have all the information about the event 
	at the time of booking. Withholding information and details about an event may result in the event being canceled. All events are tentative until supporting 
	policies and/or required forms have been accepted and approved.
</p>
<p>
	The Event Services Office reserves the right to cancel any event if they feel that the event is not in the best interest of the Unions. Policies exist regarding 
	special events for such services as overtime, labor, security and special room setup. These services will incur additional charges above and beyond the room 
	rental and catering charges. Please make sure to meet with an Event planner to discuss all details in full when requesting space in the Unions or when planning 
	an event. It is the responsibility of the client to provide all information regarding their event to the Arizona Student Unions&rsquo; staff to ensure a smooth 
	and successful event.
</p>
<h2>Alcohol Policy</h2>
<p>
	Any event requesting service of alcohol will need to complete and submit
	a &#8220;<a href="/alcohol/">request
	for alcohol service</a>&#8221;  to
	the Event Services Office, room 348 in the Student Union Memorial Center (621-1989).
	The Arizona Student Unions do not have a liquor license, therefore our service
	personnel are unable to serve alcohol during events. You are not permitted
	to bring in your own alcohol or to serve alcohol at any event or to serve it
	at the guest tables. For more information about the policies governing serving
	alcohol at events, please contact the Event Planing Office or go to: <a href="/alcohol">http://union.arizona.edu/alcohol.</a>
</p>
<h2>Music/Noise Policy</h2>
<p>
	Special events that include music, dancing or any type of performance need to schedule the entire ballroom for their event to avoid possible sound conflicts.  
	Because noise may impact surrounding events, special events will only be booked into the ballroom when the entire Grand ballroom is available. This policy applies 
	regardless of how many people are estimated to attend the event.  Clients will need to pay for the entire Grand ballroom rental fee in addition to any catering or 
	special services incurred by the event. Please see note below regarding special pricing for prom events.
</p>
<h2>Event Set-Up</h2>
<p>
	When booking an event, the Arizona Student Unions and Student Union Memorial Center will allow a reasonable time for the client to set up. We are not able to allow 
	clients to bring in items the day before their event or to store any items before or after their event.  Requesting the ballroom all day for an evening event may result 
	in additional rental charges, please discuss this in advance with your event coordinator.
</p>
<h2>Student Union Memorial Center Hours</h2>
<p>
	The general building hours for the Student Union Memorial Center (SUMC) are 6:30am to 10pm, Monday through Friday and 8am to 10pm on Saturday and Sunday.  Building 
	hours will vary somewhat during holidays, summers and break schedules. During some of these dates, the Union is closed. A fee is always assessed to open the building 
	when it is closed. The charges depend on the type of event and the amount of labor involved in supporting the event. It is at the discretion of the Arizona Student 
	Unions to open the SUMC during any closed times to accommodate an event. Please consult an event planner if your event is near a holiday weekend or during traditional 
	non-UA class times to assure that the building will be open. Please be prepared to pay an overtime charge for anything before or after the general building hours.

</p>
<h2>Special Event Reservations</h2>
<p>
	For any special event, you must sign a contract for Arizona Student Unions services and must provide the Unions with a non-refundable deposit to hold your reservation. 
	All room rental, catering and special fees must be paid in full before the event takes place. The Event Services office accepts the following major credit cards: Visa, 
	MasterCard and American Express. The Arizona Student Unions reserve the right to cancel an event at any time if they feel the event is not in the best interest of the 
	Student Union.
</p>
<h2>Food Provision</h2>
<p>
	The Arizona Student Unions must provide all food for special events. The exception
	is for wedding cakes which may be ordered from an outside vendor. All fees
	for catering must be paid before the date of the event. Once the final guarantee
	is given, the remaining balance is to be paid in full. The final guarantee
	is due 3 working days before the event. The menu for the event is due a minimum
	of 2 weeks before the event date. All final details on room setup and audiovisual
	needs are due at least (1) one week prior to the event.
</p>
<h2>Parking</h2>
<p>
	Parking is not provided by the Arizona Student Unions. Please contact Special Events parking at the University of Arizona Parking and Transportation department at 
	621-3710 for any questions regarding parking for your event. The closest garage to the Student Union Memorial Center (SUMC) is the Second Street garage located on 
	the corner of Second St. and Mountain Ave.  Please note that game days and other University events will affect the number of parking spaces close to the SUMC and 
	it&rsquo;s important for clients to consider this when planning their events.
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
	Security must be provided for special events unless otherwise waived by Student Union Operations administrative staff. Security is to be provided by UAPD (University 
	of Arizona Police Department) and arrangements for UAPD officers including payment of security is to be arranged through the UAPD department by contacting them directly 
	at 626-6728. Determination for number of officers necessary for security for events is the responsibility of UAPD. This will be discussed with the client when the request 
	for security is made through UAPD.
</p>
<h2>Proms &amp; Dances</h2>
<p>
	Proms and Dances are required to pay a facility rental fee of $3000.00 for the SUMC Grand ballroom. The fee covers the cost of the Grand ballroom from the opening of 
	the building 8am until the scheduled closing time of the building. Additional overtime charges apply for any events scheduled past the building&rsquo;s hours. The 
	Grand ballroom must be scheduled for any dance events regardless of how many people are scheduled to attend to avoid any potential sound issues with neighboring events. 
	Proms can only be scheduled if the entire Grand Ballroom is available. Please note that overtime and clean up charges also apply in addition to the rental fee. The 
	minimum clean up charge is $150 and the over time charge is $50/hour for each hour or increment of an hour past the SUMC scheduled building hours. All proms need to 
	have their band, DJ,  planning committee and decorators out of the building by 1am. The overtime charge jumps up to $200/hour after 2am.
</p>
<p>
	Please allow sufficient time to load out when planning the end time of your dance. Building hours for the Student Union are: Monday through Friday in the Fall/Spring: 
	6:30am to 10pm Saturday and Sunday in the Fall/Spring: 8am to 10pm, Monday through Friday in the Summer: 6:30am to 9pm, Saturday and Sunday in the Summer: 8am to 9pm
</p>
<p>
	All paperwork including a dance request and a signed copy of the <a href="/operations/policies/dances.php">Arizona Student Unions&rsquo; dance policy</a> must be 
	completed at least (15) working days before the prom date. All proms and dances are tentative until all policies have been met and the dance request has been approved 
	by the Assistant Director of Facilities and Operations for the Arizona Student Unions.
</p>
<h2>Right of Refusal</h2>
<p>
	University departments may request space in the Union up to 2 years in advance from the date of their conference or special event. The Arizona Student Unions reserve 
	the right to schedule Student Union sponsored programs before other campus event requests.
