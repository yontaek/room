All Arizona Student Unions property is to be accounted for and left in the condition it was received. Moving furniture within rooms or from one room to another is not allowed. Cost for resetting moved furniture or misuse of Arizona Student Unions property will be charged to the reserving groups.</p>
<p><b>Rental Items</b><br>
	Property supplied by organizations or businesses outside of the Arizona Student Unions is to be removed from the Union premises immediately after the event to avoid the cost of storage.</p>
<p><b>SUMC Access</b><br>
	Arizona Student Unions staff (i.e. Operations managers) are to have access to all facilities at all times.</p>
<p><b>Food/Beverages</b><br>
	Arizona Student Unions policy prohibits bringing food or beverages from outside sources into the building. All food orders must be submitted to the Event Services Office (2) two weeks before the event.</p>
<p><b>Alcoholic Beverages</b><br>
  Permission to serve alcoholic beverages during events must be made through
  the Event Services Office, room 348 in the Student Union Memorial Center (621-1989).
  A &quot;<a href="/alcohol">request to serve alcohol form</a>&quot;  must
  be submitted for approval by the requesting group. Arrangements must be made
  by the requesting group with an outside bartending service that meets the University
  insurance requirements to serve alcohol on campus. The Arizona Student Unions
  do not have a liquor license therefore our service personnel are unable to
  serve alcohol during events. For more information about the policies governing
  serving alcohol at events, please contact the Event Planing Office or go to:
